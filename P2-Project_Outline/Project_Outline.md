1. Overview: 
I would like to create a website that people can use to find trivia events in their local area. It isn't easy to find good hot-spots for trivia unless your in the know or know someone who knows the good spots. The website would allow users to log in and view a listing of all hosts that could be sorted by various options like name, rank, distance from user and whether or not food is available. Once a user finds a venue that tickles their fancy they can click on the name of any host and TriviaFinder will direct them the host profile where the user can garner all the information that they need to make an informed decision. 

2. Features: 
	-Description homepage with navigation to registration, login and the main forum
	-Registration for both Users and Hosts
	-Login system for users
	-Sortable table of hosts by various criteria
	-Profile pages for each host
	-Ability for users to give rankings and reviews for hosts
	-Google Map and API integration for distance calculation between user and host and maps on each host profile page

3. Technologies:
	-HTML
	-Spring
	-Thymeleaf
	-Bootstrap
	-Java 
	-MySQL
	-Google Maps and API
4. What Iâ€™ll have to learn: 
	I will need to learn how models and their tables relate to each other and how to setup those relationships in the program. I have no knowledge of Google Maps and API so that will be a large hurdle to overcome and learn. While I have used Spring, Thymeleaf and Bootstrap before I will need to broaden my knowledge of each to successfully integrate all the intended features.
